# happyBot
## Runs as Below in the Anaconda Environment/ Anaconda Prompt

### Motivation
  + ChatBots are the new AI tool and are getting a Lot of attention, some are used by *Slack *Twitter etc
  + ChatBots involve good amount of Natural language processing to begin with
  + We are making a Chat Bot called "HappyBot" that can react and predict sentences based on user input and which could be scalable for more functions per demand and bandwidth
  + Currently we are using the NLTK module to do some of the processing
  + Our Goal would be to make a highly interactive GUI based BOT that will interact with users and will learn from interactions and from the knowledge it gathers from the web/google/twitter/wikipedia etc .
  + As our processing needs increase we will also think of making the project more scalable

### Tools
  + python, Jupyter Notebooks

### Resources Used
